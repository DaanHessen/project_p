My name is Daan Hessen, and I'm 23 years old. I've worked in the restaurant side of the hospitality industry for about seven years now.During that time, I’ve gained a lot of experience and learned a great deal. But I also discovered that my true passion doesn’t lie in hospitality.

That’s why, two years ago, I decided to start studying HBO-ICT at the University of Utrecht. It wasn’t a random choice—technology and its rapid development have always fascinated me, and I’ve always been curious about how things work and why they work the way they do.I never thought of turning that curiosity into a career, but I’m glad I took the leap. Now, two years into my studies, I’ve chosen to specialize in Software Development.

Alongside my studies, I currently work at a new local restaurant in Hilversum called BASE by MONSEES.I’ve been working as a bartender for Brasserie Monsees for nearly three years, and I’m excited to be part of this new concept.Brasserie Monsees has since moved to ’s-Graveland, making room for BASE. If you’d like to know more about the restaurant, you can check out basebymonsees.nl—a website I’m building as part of my learning journey. It’s been a great way to apply what I’ve been studying and pick up a lot of new skills along the way.
